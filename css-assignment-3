<h2> The Eiffel Tower was once the tallest building in the world.</h2><br>
At the time of its grand opening in 1889, the Eiffel Tower became the tallest building in the world, standing proudly over Paris at 312 meters (1,024 feet) and overtaking the Washington Monument's record of 169 meters (554 feet). Forty years later, however, New York City’s Chrysler Building emerged at 319 meters (1,046 feet), holding the new record until the Empire State Building’s debut in 1931 at a whopping 381 meters (1,250 feet). Nevertheless, it’s quite an accolade to have held the title for 40 years.</p></main>
